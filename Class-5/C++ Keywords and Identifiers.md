## ðŸ”¹ Example Usage

    ```c++
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    int main() {
        constexpr int x = 10; // Using constexpr keyword
        static_assert(x > 0, "x must be positive"); // Using static_assert

        cout << "Value of x: " << x << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    constexpr in C++: Purpose & Usage

    The constexpr keyword in C++ specifies that a variable, function, 
    or object must be evaluated at compile-time. It helps in optimization and performance improvements by ensuring that expressions are computed before runtime.

## 1. C++ Identifiers

Identifiers are the unique names given to variables, classes, functions, or other entities by the programmer. For example

    ```cpp
    int fruit;
    double bankBalance;
    ```
Here, fruit and bankBalance are identifiers.

### Rules for naming identifiers

    - Identifiers can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character.
    - It has no limit on name length.
    - It must begin with either a letter or an underscore.
    - It is case-sensitive.
    - We cannot use keywords as identifiers.
