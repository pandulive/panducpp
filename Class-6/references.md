# References

In C++, we use a reference to create an alias for a variable. We can use the reference variable to access or modify the variable.

Create a C++ Reference
We use the ampersand sign to create a reference. For example,

```cpp
string& ref_city = city;
```

Here,

- string - datatype of the variable
- & - denotes we are creating a reference
- ref_city - name of the reference variable
- city - the variable for which reference is created
